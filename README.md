In this dataset i have to find the varience of the given dataset 

Variance is a measure of how spread out a distribution is. It is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.
The smaller the variance, the less spread out the data is. Conversely, the larger the variance, the more spread out the data is.
Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. It is calculated as the square root of the variance.
The smaller the standard deviation, the closer the data points are to the mean. Conversely, the larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the data points are.
The stock market's volatility is the best use case for variance and standard deviation.

What i did in my dataset was i assigned to find which country has stable income 
Income datas were availabel i have to find the varience and standard deviation for finding which country have stable income
So I need to find 
# MEAN --> =AVERAGE(B3:B10)
Then Income - Mean after that squaring those values

Total    =SUM
Count    =COUNT
Variance  =TOTAL/COUNT
Standard Deviation = Squaring the varience

# output

I got varience 30 for juganda and varience 895 for kurance 
# so country JUGANDA has the stable cause it has less varience

# less varience --> More consistent data and similar to each other
# High avrience --> Less consistent data and performance is low
